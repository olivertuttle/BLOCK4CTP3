What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?

In programming Id definetely like to learn how to figure out and solve issues inside of a code, because ive learned how to follow programming instructions but theres a lot of errors that appear that i do not know how to fix

What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?

like i said, the part of trying to find the errors in a code or how to activate your code into programming, because sometimes it just falls through for a reason that i cant grasp onto


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

I wanna learn how to do cool little things outside of school with this information, like how to code a discord bot or something fun like that
